# The Longest If statement
This 'If' statment is too long, even for the task which it needed to complete it's too long. \
 "So why", you ask, "why did you make it that big?? ", well to be honest  I don't know. At the time I thought it was too big to, but I didn't know how to make it better so I left it as is, and written the exact same thing 3 months later, *genius*.
